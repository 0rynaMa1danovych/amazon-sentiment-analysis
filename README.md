# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict customer sentiment from large volumes of text reviews. Using a dataset of Amazon product reviews, I built and evaluated multiple models that can automatically classify reviews as positive or negative.
This approach could be extended to real-world applications in which companies need to monitor customer feedback on a large scale, such as classifying social media comments or product reviews, without relying on manual review.
